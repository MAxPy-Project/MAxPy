=====

**MAxPy** is a framework aimed for simulation and exploration of Approximate Computing techniques in VLSI designs. It is Ptyhon-based, free and *open-source* (available in `Github <https://github.com/MAxPy-Project/MAxPy>`_).

MAxPy is part of the **MAxPy Project** - a growing collaborative effort to make Approximate Computing available to the community via easily applicable tools. Check out our `organization page <https://github.com/MAxPy-Project>`_ at Github.
